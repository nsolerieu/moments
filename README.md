an improvised instagram replacement gallery

I'm building this thing because there doesn't seem to be much satisfiying alternative to instagram. I want a place to store all of my photos that are currently scattered accross google drive, my phone library, my old phones, my instagram backup, a bunch of old SD cards. I don't intend to store and showcase high quality images and will focus of the "visual" journalling here. Many of the photos were taken a while ago and I have come to appreciate the content more than the quality of the image (I liked this about instagram). I have little interest in the device or metadata so will only have the filename. The UI should reflect the intent and be extremely simple. As I'm trying to not grow my footprint, I'll compress the images as much as possible as jpg and will host them here to clear out my cloud accounts.
